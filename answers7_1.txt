1) Its defining property is having   normal/ gaussian distributed  probability density function.
2) A low pass filter reduces the amplitude of high frequency signals while allowing  low frequency filters to pass unimpeded
3) The moving average filter takes an average value from input signals. Thus it is not sensitive to high frequency signals with a high amplitude. Therefore the moving average filter is a low pass filter.
