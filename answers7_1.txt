1) Its defining property is having   normal/ gaussian distributed  probability density function.
2) A low pass filter reduces the amplitude of high frequency signals while allowing  low frequency filters to pass unimpeded

3) The moving average filter takes an average value "from a number of points". 
Then it compares it with an input signal. 
If the input signal has a higher frequency resulting in a higher amplitude or a lower frequency with a lower amplitude the moving average filter can be a high pass filter or a low pass filter depending on the input.
